// In this scenario, based on how its implemented, T2 cannot read x2
// from any valid site because at the time T2(RO) started, all sites are down
// except 2 and 2 has just recovered and x2 is replicated so we cannot read from it.
// so here T2 just waits. It is waiting for either a transaction to commit some
// value to x2 at site 2 or any other site so T2 can read it.
// T2 can also commit just fine since its not holding a lock on x2
